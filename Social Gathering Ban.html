            <p>The "Prevention and Control of Disease (Prohibition on Group Gathering) Regulations (Cap. 599G)" related to the gathering restriction order was launched as early as March. Various government departments have made a total of 450,000 inspections, nearly 60,000 warnings, and more than 4,700 Fixed penalty tickets, and 47 prosecutions. The ticket control rate of the "restriction order" is about 1%, that is, a ticket will be issued for every 100 inspections.</p>
            <p>Media surveys and expert observations have found that many places do not strictly abide by the government's epidemic prevention restrictions, including restaurants and bars that are full of occupancy, violating the occupancy limit, and many diners take off their masks during non-eating hours and talk loudly, making it very easy for the virus to spread. diffusion. As for the hotel, it has even become a place for some unconscious citizens to escape the restrictions on gatherings and hold parties. They use the so-called staycation as an excuse to gather people in hotel rooms to carnival. It can be seen that even if the government departments have made regulatory complaints, the places that can be monitored are limited. In private places, the self-discipline of citizens is mainly relied on. Therefore, the restriction order cannot cover group gatherings in all places.</p>
